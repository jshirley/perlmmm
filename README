PerlMMM - The Perl Monger's Meeting Manager

This application comes in 3 parts.  One is the storage mechanism, which is
PerlMMM::Meeting::Manager.  This includes the second part, which is pluggable
storage backends.  Right now that means only Movable Type.

The final part is to come, which is a Catalyst-based front-end that allows easy
editing and propagation to multiple storage locations so you can get the most
visibility for your meetings.
